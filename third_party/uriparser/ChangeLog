      length zero as equal, by mistake.
      Thanks to Robert Kausch and his Coverity report.
  * Fixed: Use-after-free in out-of-memory code of uriMakeOwner.
      Thanks to Chris Hills and his Klocwork-based report (bug #28)
  * Soname: 1:19:0

2015-04-27 -- 0.8.2

  * Fixed: Broken conversion from/to Windows network shares (bug #21)
      Thanks to Adam Gross and Dmitry Repkin!

      As a side effect, this fixes the test suite for AArch64.
      Thanks to Marcin Juszkiewicz for the patch!
  * Fixed: MinGW Makefile:
      LIB_DIR fixed from ../../lib leftover to ../../src (bug #27)
      Thanks to Dmytro Zagashev for the report!

  * Fixed: Sync URI_VER_* preprocessor defines (were at 0.7.6, bug #23)
  * Fixed: Bug in internal function that may flip uriEqualsUri results around
  * Added: Function uriAddBaseUriEx allowing to resolve URIs with
      a scheme identical to that of the base URI to resolve against

      URI_RESOLVE_IDENTICAL_SCHEME_COMPAT is specified (feature request #4)
  * Soname: 1:17:0

2014-07-12 -- 0.8.0.1

2013-12-20 -- 0.8.0

  * Fixed: Resolution of relative URI "/" broken
      Thanks to Mo McRoberts for the patch!
  * Fixed: uriAddBaseUri produced uriUri objects with both host
      and the absolutePath flag set (while the absolutePath flag
      should only be true for URI objects without a host) when
      resolving absolute URIs like "/" or "/foo/bar".
      Now the absolutePath flag is set to URI_FALSE and an empty
      segment is added as necessary
  * Fixed: .errorCode could end up unset, previously
      Thanks to Radu Hociung for the patch!  (bug #16)
  * Fixed: Resolve use of non-POSIX "sed -r" used when building

      section, e.g. "http://::@host/"
  * Soname: 1:12:0

  * Fixed: Compile error from Doxygen when configuring with
      neither --enable-doc nor --disable-doc
  * Fixed: Code documentation errors
      Thanks to Valentin Haenel for the patch!
  * Fixed: Fix include path in pkg-config, i.e. remove
      "/uriparser" suffix as uriparser's headers are meant to
      be included by statements like #include <uriparser/....> .
      Thanks to Philip de Nier for reporting!
  * Fixed: Compilation in context of Eclipse + Cygwin + wchar_t
      (bug #10)
      Thanks to Gary Mazzaferro for reporting!

  * Fixed: File Doxyfile.in was missing from release archives
      Thanks to Rakesh Pandit for reporting!
  * Fixed: Doc generation troubles
  * Changed: No longer shipping bundled libcpptest
  * Changed: New dependencies:
      - libcpptest 1.1.0 or later
      - pkg-config
      The libcpptest dependency can be disabled through
      configuring with --disable-test, which excludes the
      test suite from compilation.
  * Soname: 1:10:0

2008-12-23 -- 0.7.4

  * Fixed: Null pointer de-referencing when dissecting query
      strings starting with "&" right after "?" (bug #7).

      - Qt Compressed Help (.qch) at <doc/uriparser-doc-*.qch>
      - Qt Help Project (.qhp) at <doc/html/index.qhp>
      Generation requires Doxygen 1.5.7.1-20081103 or later.
  * Soname: 1:8:0

2008-09-01 -- 0.7.2

  * Fixed: Bad cleanup logic in functions
      - uriAddBaseUri(..)
      - uriRemoveBaseUri(..)
      Previously you needed to call uriFreeUriMembers on return code
      URI_ERROR_MALLOC and only then. So that's why these functions now
      take cleanup off your shoulders. An extra call to uriFreeUriMembers
      from your side is still needed in case of success.
  * Soname: 1:7:0

2008-04-27 -- 0.7.1

  * Fixed: Bogus syntax error when parsing URIs with port-like
      passwords, e.g. "http://user:21@host/" (bug #1)
      Thanks to Friedrich Delgado Friedrichs for reporting!
  * Fixed: Parser did not handle trailing slashes correctly in some cases,
      which also made the structures produced from parsing "http://e.com/"
      and "http://e.com" indistinguishable. (bug #2)
      Thanks to Edward Z. Yang for reporting!

2008-02-25 -- 0.6.4

      e.g. "../../a/b/.././c" is normalized to "../../a/c"
  * Fixed: Normalization code could free foreign memory
  * Fixed: Normalization processed the path segment even when asked not to
  * Added: MinGW Makefile and related readme
      Thanks to Michael Anthony Puls II!
  * Fixed: Documentation bug not requiring enough memory for the output
      buffer when converting a relative file URI back to a filename

  * Added: RemoveBaseUri function to create URI references
  * Added: Unix/Windows filename <--> URI string conversion helpers
  * Added: EscapeEx function to escape text blocks without zero termination
  * Fixed: Bug in ToString for URIs with scheme, path, but no host (e.g. "f:/.//g")
  * Fixed: AddBase now resolves ".//g" with base "f:/a" to "f:/.//g" instead of
      "f://g" which would result in "g" becoming the authority part when parsing
      a recomposition (ToString) of that URI structure. This is a whole in RFC 3986,
      see http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2007Aug/0003.html for details.

  * Added: Percent-encoding function Escape
  * Improved: Malloc/NULL checks added
  * Added: New function UnescapeInPlaceEx can also decode '+' to ' '
      and convert line breaks
  * Added: Exact space computation for ToString, see ToStringCharsRequired
  * Added: --enable-sizedown for saving space and slower code
  * Fixed: Two internal functions were exposed in the API by mistake:
      uriPushToStack and uriStackToOctet
  * Added: Visual Studio 2005 project files
  * Removed: Legacy code (removal was announced for 0.5.0)

2007-07-06 -- 0.4.1
